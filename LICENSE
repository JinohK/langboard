This License Agreement (“Agreement”) governs the use of the Langboard software (the “Software”), developed and maintained by the Langboard team (the “Licensor”).

The Software is made available under a source-available, fair-use license: the source code is accessible for inspection, learning, modification, and internal use, but certain commercial uses—particularly those involving resale or the provision of hosted services—require a commercial license agreement with the Licensor.

- Organization: A legal entity such as a company, institution, or non-profit body identified by a business registration number or equivalent.
- Instance: A deployed copy of the Software running in an isolated execution environment (e.g., server, virtual machine, container, or cloud service).
- Internal Use: Use of the Software solely within an Organization for its own business processes, research, or operations, without offering the Software as a service to third parties.
- Commercial Use: Any use of the Software that generates direct or indirect revenue, including but not limited to SaaS offerings, resale, redistribution, or bundled commercial solutions.
- GitHub Sponsors: The official GitHub funding platform ([https://github.com/sponsors/yamonco](https://github.com/sponsors/yamonco)) through which supporters may contribute financially to the Licensor.

2. Modification: You may modify, fork, and adapt the Software for your own purposes.

4. Contribution: You may contribute code, bug reports, or documentation back to the Licensor under open contribution guidelines.

5. Community Sharing: You may share knowledge, tutorials, and derivative works, provided you do not misrepresent such works as official Langboard distributions.
